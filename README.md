# Project Description

In this project, I need to write a program finding the relation between items bought by customers: 

_ Convert the Groceries dataset which contains a collection of receipts into a transaction dataset where each row contains the following information: CustomerID, Date of purchase, no_of_items(k), item1, item2, ..., itemk. 

_ Convert the transaction dataset into an itemset list which has all information of purchased items.

_ Convert the itemset list into support list which has:
+ All sub itemsets.
+ The frequency of all itemsets in the list by calculating the occurrence of these.

_ Convert the frequency data into the list of association rule which has relationships among large sets of data items having more than 2 items based on “Association Rules” algorithm.12123

_ Apply Quicksort to the dataset to optimize the process.
